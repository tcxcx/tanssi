## Overview

Foresta Node provides the technological foundation for the Foresta Protocol, a decentralized platform designed to support carbon credit issuance and retirement processes at an enterprise level. It leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity, transparency, and security of carbon credit transactions.

## Features

- **Carbon Credit Management:** Efficient handling of carbon credit issuance, trading, and retirement.
- **KYC Integration:** Ensures compliance with global standards through a Know Your Customer (KYC) framework.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Components:** Incorporates DeFi features such as pools and decentralized exchanges (DEX) for carbon credit trading.
- **Governance:** Facilitates community governance through Foresta Collectives, enabling proposal submission and voting.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Substrate development environment setup.
- Rust and Cargo installed.
- Git for code repository cloning.

### Installation

1. Clone the Foresta node repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tcxcx/foresta-node.git
    cd foresta-node
    ```

2. Build the node (The first build might take up to 30 minutes depending on your machine's specifications):

    ```bash
    cargo build -p container-chain-template-simple-node --release
    ```

### Running the Node

1. Run the node in development mode with sealing enabled:

    ```bash
    ./target/release/container-chain-template-simple-node --dev --sealing 6000
    ```

2. Access the node and perform operations using the Polkadot.js.org/apps interface. Set the interface to connect to your local development node.
